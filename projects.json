This project demonstrates advanced graphics programming techniques including:\n\n• Physically Based Rendering (PBR) pipeline\n• Real-time shadows with cascade shadow mapping\n• Deferred rendering for optimal performance\n• Post-processing effects (SSAO, Bloom, Tone mapping)\n• Model loading with Assimp integration\n• Custom shader management system\n• Frustum culling and occlusion culling optimization\n\nThe renderer supports various lighting models, material systems, and provides a flexible architecture for creating complex 3D scenes. Performance optimizations include instanced rendering, GPU-driven rendering, and efficient memory management.",
